# ECS Taster 2022 Machine Learning Labs

Earlier you had a lecture about how simple differentiation and an algorithm called gradient descent can be used to train the parameters of computer programs so they solve specific tasks. In this lab session we're going to explore this idea in more detail and build some machines (programs) that learn to make predictions from data - this is very much an introduction to topic of machine learning from the ground up.

These lab sessions are going to use the `python` language together with a widely used numerical library called `numpy` which has optimised implementations of methods for manipulating vectors and matrices. Like the in this morning's lab session we'll use a web-based `python` environment called Google Colab. Because we're going to be increasingly pushing you out of you comfort zone in this lab please just ask if you get stuck or have questions.

To get started we're going to take a crash course in `python` and `numpy`. Click the link below to open the first part of the lab. If you have a Google account you might want to log in so you can save your progress to your Google Drive by making a copy of the lab "notebook" by pressing the "Copy to Drive" button near the top left of the Colab interface.

Part 1: Intro to Python & Numpy: [![Part 1: Intro to Python & Numpy](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1CPSvlF1jvMq9v9zdbyYsH54ypYh4npr6){:target="_blank"} [download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jonhare/ecs-taster-ml-labs/main/Intro%20to%20Python%20%26%20Numpy.ipynb)

Once you've worked through the introduction you can progress onto the next lab where you'll implement a simple, but extremely powerful machine learning model called linear regression.

Finally, the last part of the lab introduces you to what is a known as a _linear classifier_ (ask us why!), implemented with an algorithm called logisitic regression:

Have fun & ask questions!
